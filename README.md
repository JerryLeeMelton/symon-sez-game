# symon-sez-game
A web game based on the classic electronic game from the 1970s.  The visual design is based on a version of the game that my folks gave me when I was a kid in the 90s.  I put the page together using SVG graphics and I added subtle animation to the background using [Kute.js](https://thednp.github.io/kute.js/).
